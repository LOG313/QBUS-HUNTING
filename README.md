# QBUS-HUNTING- 
FIRST OF ALL I DID NOT MAKE THIS SCRIPT | CREDIT GOES TO https://github.com/daccakareem



I simply edited this hunting script to make it so it is required to have a guns license to see the sniper and ammo.
If you do not have a guns license you can only see the feed and the shop is labeled "NO GUNS LICENSE" while when
you have a guns license it is labeled "GUNS LICENSE VERIFIED".
